Game-of-life
============

An implementation of (Conway's) game of life, perhaps with visualisation

Feel free to add some sort of visualisation, SDL perhaps (I intend to do this at one point or another). 
Or perhaps you can fix the curses visualisation (currently the program crashes with a segfault when I run wrefresh();).
